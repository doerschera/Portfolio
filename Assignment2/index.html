          <p class="bio col-xs-12">I'm a print and web designer based in Austin, TX. My design aesthetic favors simplicity and ease of use in conjunction with bright, clean colors and linear forms. I have always been drawn to narrative and try to use design as a vehicle for storytelling, wether that story is text-based or client-based. I received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Rhode Island School of design and also spent a year in the Master of Architecture program at the University of Michigan. Outside of design work, I am a published poet and like to relax with knitting and podcasts.

The store also hosted several opening and events, including the “30/30” show, which celebrated young female artists and raised money for a local women’s shelter.

The goal was create a guest card that was compatible with a new online registration system that collects visitor’s information prior to their arrival on campus. The card responds to several needs of the office and guests: First, it facilitates an interaction between the visitor and office staff as each visitor is greeted with a personalized card, viewbook, and map. Second, the card allows staff to keep track of information, allowing guests to update incorrect information, and providing staff with a quick visual of the number of attending guests at an event. Finally, the card provides a small glimpse into the lifestyle and atmosphere of RISD and encourages guests to personalize it with their own notes and doodles. The cards are first printed flat to accommodate the over-printing of guest information via a normal desk printer and are then folded when they are inserted into each viewbook. A perforation at the fold allows the information side of the card to be detached if a correction is need.</p>

This first project depicts a proposal for a hotel and sensory deprivation spa sited in an up and coming Toronto neighborhood. The goal of these drawings is to depict an accurate representation of both space and activity. A 90-90 axonometric projection is used as a tool of obfuscation, mimicking the possible disorienting effects of emerging from a sensory deprivation experience. Similarly, the extreme act of sensory deprivation is reflected in the stark colors and forms. The second illustration is one of three panels that depicts a whimsical scene, which was generated from random subjects. These subjects were suburbia, equestrian horse jumping, and the styling of TeamLab's <em>Flower and Corpse Glitch Set</em>, which features a digital wireframe cloud.

                  <p class="hidden-sm hidden-xs text">This piece, as well as the next, investigate the psychology of domestic spaces. We often think of domestic spaces as inherently safe, a haven from the anxiety of the outside world. Instead, I sought to reveal the latent discomfort of interior spaces and the possibility of a reciprocal relationship between psychology and space. The white wall has three peep holes, two of which are covered by the sheet and another blocked by the frosted acrylic-- the facade is both perorated and inaccessible. The second side of the piece is a narrow corridor painted with dark blue colors. The two tub spouts are made of frozen milk, both a symbol of night time comfort and a strange material of its own right. As the exhibition continues, the milk spouts begin to melt, allowing the milk to pool and run beneath the white barrier.</p>
